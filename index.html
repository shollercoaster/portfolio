                    <p> Greetings! This is Saumya, a fresher from NSUT pursuing BTech in ECE with a specialization in AI, who loves cats, meeting new people, learning about everything, but most particularly about computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, unravelling our consciousness, and what's better: a combination of them all! I have been particularly interested in AI, thinking about its bright/gloomy future in our world, and most importantly how we can use the knowledge of building independent rational moral systems, to understand ourselves.

                        <p> I have worked with neural networks, different machine learning classification methods and the basic maths around those models, and have ventured into Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I have learnt formal math and logic, as well as dabbled in quantum computing. Other than that I can program well in Python, C and C++, JavaScript, MySQL and HTML. Keeping aside professional interests, I love reading, writing, watching movies and listening to podcasts! I am also a prolific public speaker and have displayed exemplary leadership skills.

                                "Writing makes you think." i guess thats true, but then why was I running away from writing? just like any other thing in my life which I know would've helped me, I really wanted to, and felt good everytime I did it, yet I still avoided it like the plague. Why the double standards? I don't know. What I do know is right now I need someone to be by my side the most, and the only person qualified and liable to do that is me. I need me. Before I need anyone else or the other way around.

                                by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
                                Bitcoins are transferable digital tokens that are created on the Bitcoin network in a process known as "mining".
                                bitcoin first value to be quickly transferred over great distance in a trustless way
                                LIMIT: only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined
                                till now: 19 million been mined (production of new bitcoins to end in 2140)
                                Every four years the number of bitcoins produced by mining halves
                                Bitcoins fall into an entirely different category of goods, known as monetary goods, whose value is set game-theoretically. I.e., each market participant values the good based on their appraisal of whether and how much other participants will value it.

                                then came collectibles: based on rarity and symbolic value (examples include shells, animal teeth, and flint)
                                - used more as "storage of value" than "medium of exchange"
                                - low velocity (lesser transfers in an individual's lifetime, but that made it more valubale like an heirloom)

                                Readers must learn specific reflective strategies. “What questions should I be asking? How should I summarize what I’m reading?” Readers must run their own feedback loops. “Did I understand that? Should I re-read it? Consult another text?” Readers must understand their own cognition. “What does it feel like to understand something? Where are my blind spots?”

                                These skills fall into a bucket which learning science calls “metacognition.”

                                If lecturers believe that lectures are a warm-up for the understanding developed through problem sets and essays, then at least the lecturers design those activities and offer feedback on students’ work. By comparison, if authors believe that understanding comes only when readers really think about their words, then they’re largely leaving readers to design their own “problem sets” and to generate their own feedback. All this effortful “thinking about thinking” competes with actually thinking about the book’s ideas.

                                Readers must decide which exercises to do and when. Readers must run their own feedback loops: did they clearly understand the ideas involved in the exercise? If not, what should they do next? What should students do if they’re completely stuck? Some issues are subtler. For example, textbook exercises are often designed to yield both a solution to that specific problem and also broader insights about the subject. Will readers notice if they solved a problem but missed the insights it was supposed to reveal?
